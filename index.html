            GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features. It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.[3]

                GitHub offers plans for both private repositories and free accounts[4] which are commonly used to host open-source software projects.[5] As of June 2018, GitHub reports having over 28 million users[6] and 57 million repositories[7] (including 28 million public repositories.[8]), making it the largest host of source code in the world.[9]
                
                On June 4, 2018, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire GitHub for US$7.5 billion.</p>

        <h1>snapchat</h1>
        <p>Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app used globally, created by Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown,[6] former students at Stanford University, and developed by Snap Inc., originally Snapchat Inc.

                One of the principal concepts of Snapchat is that pictures and messages are only available for a short time before they become inaccessible. The app has evolved from originally focusing on person-to-person photo sharing to presently featuring "Stories" of 24-hour chronological content, along with "Discover" to let brands show ad-supported short-form entertainment. Snapchat has become notable for representing a new, mobile-first direction for social media, and places significant emphasis on users interacting with virtual stickers and augmented reality objects. As of February 2018, Snapchat has 187 million daily active users</p>
